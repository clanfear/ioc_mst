# Classic Deterrence

Basic idea: *You can **prevent crime** using **punishment***

Deterrence has long been basis for criminal justice policy

???

Classic deterrence principles underlie modern justice approaches in Europe and the US

--

.pull-left-70[
Beccaria (1764) *On Crimes and Punishments*

* People are rational and self-interested

   * *Individuals know what is best for them and act accordingly*
   * Restrain liberty only to *protect others*

]

.pull-right-30[
![](img/beccaria_cesare_ritratto.jpg)
]

???

Specifically, deterrence goes back to Beccaria, generally considered the founding father of criminology

Individuals were seen to have no external influences on behavior and would correctly evaluate the consequences of all possible actions to take the result that maximizes pleasure and minimizes pain

This means people know best what is good for them, so we should maximize their freedom

But sometimes the best action for an individual hurts others, infringing on their liberty

To Beccaria, and other utilitarians, this is the only justified reason to infringe on free choice

# Classic Deterrence

Basic idea: *You can **prevent crime** using **punishment***

Deterrence has long been basis for criminal justice policy

.pull-left-70[
Beccaria (1764) *On Crimes and Punishments*

* People are rational and self-interested

   * *Individuals know what is best for them and act accordingly*
   * Restrain liberty only to *protect others*

* **Deterrence**

   * Punish only to *prevent crime* (not rehabilitate)
   * Punish only so much as *necessary*
   * Goal: *Make crime the irrational choice.*
]

.pull-right-30[
![](img/beccaria_cesare_ritratto.jpg)
]

???

If people maximize pleasure and minimize pain, we can increase pain of harmful choices

But we do not want to harm more than is needed; we want to do only so much harm as is necessary to prevent social harm.

Beccaria's deterrence was not a criminological theory but a policy position resulting from his horror and disgust over barbaric European legal codes and police actions.

A problem with this approach is calculating the right punishment. Even if you can measure it, pleasure from a criminal act might differ for everyone. Jeremy Bentham believed this was all quantifiable--a hedonic calculus. But Bentham was also a bit of a weird guy. His clothed skeleton and wax head are on display at University College, London, in accordance with his wishes.

# Modern Criminology

* Criminology rejected rational actor, adopted subcultural theories

    + No role for structure or context
    + Crime as irrational behaviour resulting from socialization
    + Focus on resocialization

???

As a discipline, Criminology drifted away from the classical rational actor model; there was no room for effects of structure or context, which they saw to be plainly related to crime.

In the first half of the 1900s, socialization and subcultural theories dominated. These emphasized rehabilitative policy responses to crime.

--

.pull-left-70[
* Deterrence (and incapacitation!) re-emerged in 70's and 80's

    + Pessimism about rehabilitative policy
    + **Rational choice**: more realistic model
       + People are *on average* rational
       + People respond to incentives
       + Structure and context matter

*We'll get back to rational choice in a bit*

]
.pull-right-30[
![](img/wilson.jpg)
]

???

In the 1970s, rising crime in lead to skepticism over rehabilitative policy

One development out of this was resurgence in interest and support for deterrence and rational choice, but with more realistic model of the actor

In modern rational choice, people's perceived rewards are idiosyncratic and taste-based; we mainly just know that on average people want *more* of it, whatever it is

James Q. Wilson's 1975 book was influential in the US for advocating for deterrence, incapacitation, and generally severe responses to crime; you'll recognize him from Wilson &amp; Kelling's Broken Windows some 7 years later.

#  Deterrence Doctrine

.pull-right-30[

???

It is still based on a rational actor, but the expected level of rationality is less perfect

If you look at large groups together, on average they behave rationally; individual people make errors of judgment, but collectively they trend toward rationality

And even though individuals make errors, on average they do respond to changes in incentives 

If punishment increases, people will commit less crime; if gains increase, they will commit more crime.

So the basic principle remains the same as classical criminology: manipulate costs to control crime

# Deterrence Concepts

&lt;br&gt;

![:width 70%](img/ethan-wilkinson-gAKslVe547M-unsplash.jpg)

---
# Marginal vs. Absolute


* **Marginal Deterrence**

   + Deterrent effect of a *penalty* compared to a *different penalty*
   + *Does the death penalty reduce more crime than life sentences?*
   + Most research is focused here—evidence is mixed

???

This is if increasing or decreasing penalties increases or decreases behavior.



--

* **Absolute Deterrence**

   + Deterrent effect of a *penalty* compared to *no penalty*
   + *Will decriminalizing drugs result in more drug use?*
   + Less research here, but evidence is fairly strong for some crimes

???

This is question of whether *any penalty at all* has an effect on a behavior.

--

&lt;br&gt;

.text-center[
*People may be more sensitive to the existence of punishment than differences in punishment*
]

???

An important idea here is that having even a very minor penalty can sometimes make a big difference, but increasing it might have little additional effect

---
# 3 Deterrence Variables

* **Certainty** of being sanctioned

   + Probability of paying cost
   + Objective Measure: *Proportion of offenders arrested*
   + Subjective Measure: *Perceived punishment probability*
   + Tittle's "Shell of Illusion"

???


Shell of Illusion: Those never committing a crime--and thus never getting away with it--overestimate sanction risk.

This is related to the illusion most people have that certain types of law violation are incredibly rare; since at least Rome philosophers have stated that if people knew how often laws were broken, they too would break them.

--

* **Severity** of the sanction

   + The cost
   + Objective Measures: *Sentence length* or *fine amount*
   + Subjective Measure: *Perceived suffering*
   
???

Subjective usually involves asking people "how bad would it be to be arrested / incarcerated"

--

* **Celerity** (swiftness) of the sanction

   + Length of time between crime and paying the cost
   
???

Most justice systems are pretty slow, so this component is not often used intentionally to control crime, and thus not often studied

The slowness may actually be a severity component too; people know they'll spend a lot of time even waiting for a hearing or trial

Strong deterrent effects of arrest may be because it occurs more quickly

--

.text-center[
*Evidence is strongest for **certainty***
]

???

Evidence suggests being arrested alone is a pretty strong deterrent, while variation in length of incarceration is often quite weak

---
# General Deterrence

*Does the **threat of punishment** deter people from crime?*

   + Perceived threat of sanctions deters individuals from crime
   + Based on perception, not personal experience
   + "Punish so that others see that they too will be punished"
   + About reducing *crime in general*

--

Research Approaches

   + Changes in crime rates before/after policy changes
   + Effects of perceived risk and severity
   + Effect of peers being arrested


???

Research on general deterrence often looks at policy changes, such as when sentences increase or police strategies change

Another vein of research looks at how perceived threats of punishment change when peers are arrested—people update their perceptions of certainty and severity as a result

---
# Specific Deterrence

*Does **being punished** deter people from committing more crime?*

   + Being punished deters individuals from committing more crime
   + Based on experience, occurs only after punishment
   + About reducing *recidivism*

???

Specific deterrence is about keeping people from reoffending

If they were punished once, they will realize they don't want that to happen again

--

Research Approaches

   + Compare incarcerated then released vs. probationers
       + *But those sent to prison may be more crime prone*
       + Challenge: Need equivalent treatment and control groups
   + Randomly vary punishment
       + Randomized arrest (e.g. Sherman &amp; Berk 1984)
   + Look at marginal cases—natural experiments
       + Same crime probation vs. incarceration
       + Harsher vs. more lenient judges

???

Causal effects of specific deterrence are hard to measure--punishment does more than just deter, as incarceration greatly disrupts the life of the offender.

It typically isn't ethical to experimentally vary *real* punishments either; can try in lab experiments, but these are contrived settings

Common approach is to look at policy changes or differences across judges when cases are randomly assigned

# Rational Choice

&lt;br&gt;

# Rational Choice Model

Deterrence focuses on sanctioning of crime.

Rational choice is a *general* theory of behaviour—not limited to crime.

--

Criminological rational choice models recognize variation in gains.
   
   + Includes material and psychic gains
   + e.g. Piliavin, Thornton, Gartner, &amp; Matsueda (1986)

![:width 50%](img/objective_rat_choice.svg)

???

Research like Piliavin et al. finds better support for rational responses to rewards than to formal punishments

This may be due to low certainty of sanctions, but high certainty of gains; most people get away with a lot before they're caught!


---
# Formalization

Rational choice models typically take a formal mathematical form.

$$
E(U) = (1-p)U(y)+pU(y-F)
$$
"Expected utility `\(E(U)\)` is function of the value of crime `\(U(y)\)`, the likelihood of being caught `\(p\)`, and the penalty if caught `\(F\)`"

???

This is conventional economic utility model

Don't estimate exact values, but rather takes advantage of basic properties

All else equal, reducing reward / increasing cost reduces value and thus likelihood of crime.

--

Becker (1968) introduced rational model of crime

   + Little impact in sociology or criminology, major in economics
   + Assumed full information
   + Material gains compared to gains from legitimate job

???

First major economic treatment of crime as rational behavior; Mainly focused on criminal justice policy. Potential offenders are assumed to know exact risks and costs of sanctioning.

--

Short &amp; Strodtbeck's (1964) decision to join a gang fight

   + **Subjective** probability of harm
   + **Bounded rationality**
   + Status and psychic rewards

???

Mixed methods work revealing participation in gang fights as rational behavior

Gang leader decides whether or not to join a fight by brandishing a gun

If he decides not to and his friends lost the fight, he will likely suffer moderate status loss with gang

If he does join fight, small chance he will need to shoot someone and end up in jail -- a very large cost

Because likelihood of jail is small, he'll probably join fight--it is rational to do so

S &amp; S also used a formal model of the same format, but focused on subjective (maybe inaccurate) risk perceptions, and bounded thinking: In a dangerous situation, available options narrow to a couple choices.

---
# Implications

* **Changing costs**

   * Increasing costs reduces offending
   * **Perceived costs** are more important than real costs
       * *Signalling high certainty can more effective than actually increasing certainty*
   * Social and emotional costs
       * *Parents and peer shaming*
       * *Job loss*

???

Deterrence of course emerges naturally from rational choice: We can act on costs

But here costs are broader than formal punishment: Take into account everything a person risks by offending

--

* **Changing gains**

   * Reducing gains reduces offending
   * **Perceived gains** are what matter
   * Monetary value of goods, emotional value of criminal acts
       * *Thefts increase when goods become easier to sell*
       * Can be difficult to act on psychic gains

???

Classic deterrence perspective viewed gains as essentially static; rational choice opens up consideration of manipulating gains

You don't need to deter behaviours no one is interested in doing or is aware is profitable.

It can be difficult to make an offense "uncool" or otherwise reduce psychic or emotional gains, but there's evidence this has occurred to some degree for some drugs, like crack, and underage smoking due to their negative effects

---
# Behavioral Economics

Pogarsky, Roche, &amp; Pickett (2018) "Offender Decision-Making in Criminology"


???

Behavioral econ emerged from cognitive psych contributions to econ research and has influenced thinking in criminological rational choice

The focus of behavioral econ is on systematic departures from rationality

--
* Bounded rationality

???

Short &amp; Strodtbeck (1964) had an early handle on this before behavioral econ

People often have very little information when acting; can't assume perfect info

People rule out many possible decisions immediately and consider only a few options, often only two: fight or do not fight

--

* Prospect Theory (Kahneman &amp; Tversky)

   + People risk averse in gains, risk seeking in losses
   + Underweight likely events, overweight unlikely events
   + *Expectations matter*

???

Strong evidence that gains/losses to crime are treated differently if a gain vs a loss

Nonlinearity in effects

Criminals likely to focus on easy guaranteed gains, but will prefer risk of larger loss to smaller certain loss, ex. resisting arrest

For same level of punishment, expectations shape later recidivism: Expecting worse, punishment deters less.

--

* Dual-Process Models

   + Much behavior is intuitive and rule (heuristic) based
   + Rational, deliberative behavior is costly
  
???

People generally like to avoid effort; rational choice thinking takes lots of effort

Most behavior is habitual and intuitive, something long recognized in sociology and social psychology

If you want to act on rational choice, need to trigger deliberative thinking; evidence exists that people who deliberate more are more averse to crime

--

* Heuristics and Biases

  + Shortcuts in uncertain environments
  + Replace hard question with easier one
  
???

May make large mistakes in reasoning by applying shortcuts or habitual behaviors to new situations

---

# Critiques

* Psychological critique

   * Deliberation is exceedingly rare
   * For most, criminal alternatives rarely considered

???

Psychology hits rational choice with a one-two punch: First, most behaviour is habitual and not the result of deliberation. Second, when deliberation occurs, people consider only narrow sets of choices—for most, crime isn't even in the decision set in most situations.

--

* Social psychological critique

   * Morals and norms dominate costs and benefits

???

Social psych adds to this by focusing on learned morals and socially-transmitted norms regulate a lot of behaviour. These are factors that lead to criminal alternatives not being considered! There are rational choice perspectives with morals and norms though, such as James Coleman's work in the 80's and 90's.

--

* Pragmatist critique

   * Desires arise situationally
   * People choose means and ends simultaneously

???

The pragmatist critique is that people don't have stable goals or desires at all. Rather, people behave habitually most of the time until it doesn't work, which causes a problem, which is a situationally created problem. Then people solve that problem by considering different sets of actions and imagined outcomes (that is, desired states) and selecting the first good set they think of. Rather than being optimizers, people muddle through.

# Criminological Theory

* *Rational actor assumptions are everywhere*
* Routine activities theory
* Situational crime prevention
* Broken windows
* Control theory

???

Routine activities is a macro-level theory but is often used with rational choice at the individual level because it is simple and compatible

Situational crim prevention explicitly invokes rational choice, picturing potential offenders as maximimising reward and minimizing risk

Broken windows uses an implicit deterrence model for offenders under the assumption disorder is a signal of low risk of sanctioning

Hirschi and others have noted rational choice is compatible with control theories, such as his version focusing on social bonds. Severing of bonds is a cost.

--

# Legal Sanctions

* "Tough-on-crime" policies

   * Poor evidence for **severity**

* Traffic enforcement

   * Speed and red light cameras (certainty)
   * Income-based fines (severity)

???

When politicians say they want to get tough on crime with harder sentences, they either implicitly or explicitly invoke deterrence: crime will go down if penalties go up

Research has found much stronger evidence for incapacitation effects of harsh penalties than deterrence: hard to commit street crime while in prison.

Traffic enforcement is an area with some interesting deterrence-based approaches: cameras can make sanctions nearly certain. Income based penalties have also been suggested as a way to make deterrent effects more similar for poor and rich offenders.

---

# Policing

.text-center[
*Deterrence and rational choice principles underlie most crime control strategies*
]

--

* Hot spots policing

   + *Direct police resources where gains from deterrence are largest*

???

Like most policing interventions, hot spots mainly targets certainty; but it also assumes rational actors don't displace to new locations due to a lack of alternate opportunities

--

* Focussed deterrence or "pulling levers"

   + *Increase real and perceived sanction risks for specific high-risk offenders*

???

Focused deterrence is like hot spots for *people*. Direct deterrence efforts at people with high payoff. It both increases perceived costs of crime (mainly certainty, but sometimes severity) and aims to increase gains from conforming behaviour through support services.

--

* Proactive and disorder policing

   + *Increase perceived sanction risks in general*
   + e.g., order maintenance policing

???

Disorder policing aims to curb disorder in hopes it also reduces more serious crime; this idea is rooted in broken windows theory, which embeds rational actor assumptions.

---

# Wrap-Up

* Deterrence is deeply embedded in the justice system

   * Derived from enlightenment principles of justice
   * Focuses on main factors justice system can control
       * Increasing **certainty** can be very effective
       * Increasing **severity** is typically inefficient

* Rational choice is a simple, broadly applicable theory of behaviour

   * **Perceived** cost and benefit are key
   * Rarity of punishment means gains often dominate decisions
   * Not always realistic—but can be useful approximation
